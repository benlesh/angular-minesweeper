#Step 8: Add a form to create a new game

At this point the game is basically done, but what if you wanted to change the parameters a little before you start?

1. Hide the grid until a game is started.
2. Add a form to update the game parameters.
3. Add some validation to the form.
4. Wire it up with a start button (submit)
