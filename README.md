# Multiplayer with SignalR Step 5: Set up Minesweeper game for user

In this step, we're going to take the Minesweeper game we already made, and put it on the screen for our user
to use.

### On the client

- Add the html from the single player project `web/index.html`.
- Change the controller to hard code a smaller grid size and mine count.
- Also copy the stylesheet over so we can use it.
